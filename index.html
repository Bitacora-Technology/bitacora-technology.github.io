        <h2>Custom integrations</h2>
        <p>
          Do you use any service you would like to integrate with your Discord server?
          If they have an API, I can do it! I already have a wide experience working
          with Stripe, Mailchimp, YouTube, Twitter, LanguageTool, etc... and I can not
          wait to continue expanding this list.
        </p>

        <h2>Tailor-made features</h2>
        <p>
          Giveaways, polls, tickets, etc... are a great way to improve your community,
          if you have any idea in mind, I can turn it into reality. If you want to try
          some of the features I have already done you can add my <a href="/free-bot"
          target="_blank"> public bot</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Server permissions</h2>
        <p>
          They might look simple, but Discord permissions are a very powerful tool. If
          you do not want to break your head, leave it to me. After setting up a couple
          servers for the last 4 years, I have learned the most optimal way to do it.
          I can also fix the permissions for already created servers.

        <h1>About me</h1>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a young software developer from Barcelona, Spain. Like most, I first used
          Discord for playing video games with my friends, but I quickly realized what
          a great tool it was for building communities. But it was not until I was coding
          a bot for the first time that I saw the infinite potential it had.

        <h2>How can you contact me?</h2>
        <p>
          You can open a ticket in my <a href="/discord-server" target="_blank">Discord server</a>,
          send a <a href="/discord-user" target="_blank">direct message</a> or via <a href="/twitter"
          target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
