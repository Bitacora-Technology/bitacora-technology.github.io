        <h1>Our services</h1>

        <h2>Custom integrations</h2>
        <p>
          Do you use any service you would like to integrate with your Discord server?
          If they have an API, we can do it! We already have a wide experience working
          with Stripe, Mailchimp, YouTube, Twitter, LanguageTool, etc... and we can't
          wait to continue expanding this list.
        </p>

        <h2>Tailor-made features</h2>
        <p>
          Giveaways, polls, tickets, etc... are a great way to improve your community,
          if you have any idea in mind, we can turn it into reality. If you want to try
          some you can add our <a href="/free-bot">public bot</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Server permissions</h2>
        <p>
          They might look simple, but Discord permissions are a very powerful tool. If
          you don't want to break your head, leave it to us. We have been creating and
          running communities for over 4 years and we have learned the most optimal way
          to do it. We can also fix the permissions for already created servers.
